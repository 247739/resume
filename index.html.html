  <div id="para1">There's nothing like finding a holy-grail makeup product.You know,the one you buy in multiples just in case, god forbid, they discontinue it. But it feels like there's a new makeup launch or a new trend on the market every day, making it really, really hard to separate the good ones from the, uh, not so good ones. So, as a die-hard makeup fan, I'm here to make your lives a little easier by helping you find those game-changing products that make your heart sing. I've swatched, swiped, and tested everything I could get my hands on to find the best makeup products that are actually worth the hype (and, you know, the cash). Keep reading for the best of the best, including everything from a long-lasting lip stain to a glow-worthy highlighter.</div>

On one end is a highlighter that makes your cheekbones popping, and on the other end is a lightweight stick contour that's so easy to blend. Regardless of which side you decide to use, neither end will have you looking streaky or dry, thanks to the hydrating lychee extract in the formula.</div>

<div id="lipstick">The key to getting your lipstick to actually stay put? A good lip pencil. This makeup product glides right on without setting into fine lines, and it leaves your lips with the perfect, subtle stain. You don't even need to wear lipstick to rock this one—just slide on the pencil and layer a lip gloss on top for an easy go-to look.</div>
<img id="pic4" src="C:\Users\Administrator\Pictures\Screenshots\1604632907-dior-1604632887.jpg"/><div id="para3" >Think of this lip oil as a stain-gloss-balm hybrid. It does it all, thanks to the cherry oil swirling around in the formula. Swipe it on and you'll immediately notice how it hydrates your lips, leaving behind a glossy finish and a hint of color.</div>

<div id="para4">When you think of a glitter face gloss, you probably imagine a product that's sticky and gritty, but this makeup product is neither. The creamy liquid formula is lightweight (because of the glycerin in the formula) and long-lasting. You can dab it on your face, your lips, or your eyes to give yourself an intergalactic-level glow.</div>

<div id="para5">Afraid of using liquid highlighter? Don’t be, it’s super easy. Apply a couple of drops of this makeup product on the high points of your face (cheekbones, temples, and the bridge of the nose) and blend. The result? A weightless, pigmented glow that’ll have people stopping in their tracks. </div>
